Falcon Programming Language Package
-----------------------------------

This package contains the JS-like Falcon language implementation (prototype).

Design rules:
- Importing this package MUST have no side effects
- Executable modules (repl, runner) are imported lazily
- Backward compatibility with older prototypes is preserved
